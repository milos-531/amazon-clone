This is an Amazon clone built using React. It is styled to look very similar to the Amazon front page. It has multiple reusable components, inluding the product component on the front page, the navbar, and the checkout product component used on the checkout page. It utilises firebase to allow registration and presistent login functionality. You're able to add products to your cart on the frontpage, and go on to view them on the checkout page, where you're able to remove products from your cart, as well as view your total.
